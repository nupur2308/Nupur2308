#### I'm currently learning  

`Machine Learning`

It's my latest obsession. The resources I've been using are... 

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/">Andrew Ng's Stanford course</a> <br /> 
<a href="https://github.com/codeforcauseorg/ML-Bootcamp-July/">An ML Bootcamp with Code for Cause</a>

This github repo is to record all my learnings as I traverse the analytics professional world. <br />
**You can reach me on Twitter: @MessyN23 and LinkedIn: @nupurgokhale**

#### Fun fact 
I'm a huge fan of cycling, and while in NY, I biked the perimeter of Manhattan just to see how long it would take me. (I took 3ish hrs because I got lost in Harlem!)
